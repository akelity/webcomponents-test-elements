### Demo of an Web Components Kit (not production ready)

This repository contains a demo of a Web Components Kit.  
The kit is a collection of reusable components that can be used to build Web Components for [**micro-lc element composer**](https://github.com/micro-lc/micro-lc-element-composer)   
  
Each component is a custom element that can be used to build a Web App.  

In this demo there are three components:

  * **Filter** - a input box that can be used to filter the list of items.
  * **Detail** - a panel that can be used to display the details of an item.
  * **Table** - a table that can be used to display a list of items.
  
Each component implements method to read and write message to the eventBus. By default the eventBus is injected in the component by micro-lc element composer.

  * **Filter** - don't need any other properties than the eventBus.
  * **Detail** - don't need any other properties than the eventBus.
  * **Table** - use the property data to inject the list of items to display.
    * An example of a list of items and related header:
    ```
      {
        header: ["Company", "Contact", "Country"],
        body: [
          ["Big Pharma Spa", "Michele Rossi", "Italy"],
          ["Insurance Ltd", "Sarah Boyle", "United Kingdom"],
          ["Utility Company S.A.", "Lalo Mandes", "Spain"],
          ["Distribution Corp", "Annette Richelieu", "France"],
          ["Manufacturing Industries gmb", "Herbert Althaus", "Germany"],
          ["Transportation Inc", "Ria Veras", "Portugal"]
        ],
      }
      ```
  
Install the dependencies:
```
npm i
```

Start the application:
```
npm start 
```

After starting the application you can't navigate the demo out of the box because the demo is related with **micro-lc element composer**.

If you want to see the demo in action you can use the following procedure:

**About micro-lc element composer:**
  * clone the [micro-lc element composer repository](https://github.com/micro-lc/micro-lc-element-composer)
  * inside micro-lc project install the dependencies using: ``` yarn install ```
  * inside micro-lc project, within the file ```/mock-server/api/v1/microlc/configuration/{configFile}/get.js``` replace the configuration content with the following:
```
{
  type: "column",
  attributes: {
    style: "display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;",
  },
  content: [
    {
      type: "element",
      tag: "script",
      url: "https://unpkg.com/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs@latest/webcomponents-loader.js",
    },
    {
      type: "element",
      url: "http://localhost:8000/dist/Filter.bundled.esm.js",
      tag: "element-filter",
    },
    {
      type: "column",
      attributes: {
        style: "display: flex; flex-direction: row;",
      },
      content: [
        {
          type: "element",
          url: "http://localhost:8000/dist/Table.bundled.esm.js",
          tag: "element-table",
          properties: {
            data: {
              header: ["Company", "Contact", "Country"],
              body: [
                ["Big Pharma Spa", "Michele Rossi", "Italy"],
                ["Insurance Ltd", "Sarah Boyle", "United Kingdom"],
                ["Utility Company S.A.", "Lalo Mandes", "Spain"],
                ["Distribution Corp", "Annette Richelieu", "France"],
                ["Manufacturing Industries gmb", "Herbert Althaus", "Germany"],
                ["Transportation Inc", "Ria Veras", "Portugal"]
              ],
            },
          },
        },
        {
          type: "element",
          url: "http://localhost:8000/dist/Detail.bundled.esm.js",
          tag: "element-detail",
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
  * run the following command: ``` yarn dev ```

**About this repository:**
  * inside this repository install the dependencies with the following command: ``` npm install ```
  * inside this repository start the application with the following command: ``` npm start ```


Now you have:
  * the Web Components Kit up and running on localhost:8000 (if the port is not 8000 you need to change it in the configuration above).
  * the micro-lc element composer up and running on localhost:3000.

You can navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the demo in action.
